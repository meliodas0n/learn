# Lambda VS Kappa Architecture. A Guide to Choosing the Right Data Processing Architecture for Your Needs.

TL; DR

Data Processing architectures like Lamdba and Kappa help businessses analyze and extract value insights from their data in real-time.

Lambda architecture users separate batch and stream processing systems, making it scalable and fault tolerant but complex to set up and maintain (as it duplicates processing logic)

Kappa architecture simplifies the pipeline with single stream processing system as it treats all data as streams, providing flexbility and ease of maintenance, but requires experience in stream processing and distributed systems

Lambda architecture is best suited when companiesi have mixed requirements for stream and batch processing e.g., for real-time analytics and multiple batch processing tasks or data lakes, while kappa architecture is ideal for continuous data pipelines real-time data processing and IoT systems.
