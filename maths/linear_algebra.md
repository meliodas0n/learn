A system of ``linear equations`` (or a ``linear system``) is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables - say, x1...xn.

A ``solution`` of the system is a list(s1, s2,....sn) of numbers that makes each equation a true statement when the values s1...sn are substituted for x1...xn respectively

The set of all possible solutions is called the `solution set` of the linear system. Two linear systems are called `equivalent` if they have same solution set.
That is, each solution of the first sytem is a solution of the second system, and each solution of the second system is a solution of the first.
